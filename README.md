bad apple, on your FX-9750GIII

Should work for fx-9750GII, fx-9860GIII, and the french version, Graph 35+E II
unsure about previous generations, but it should proabably work. If it does, make a PR!

Recommeded that you install FTune3 and overclock you calculator, as the code isnt very optimized.

Download the .g1a file and the .bin file, and place to the root of your calculator

If you need to recompile, download the fxsdk
